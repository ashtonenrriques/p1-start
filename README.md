# Project 1 

1. Software Used: Standard python code is used along with numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries no additional software is needed to run the code.

2. Accessing the Code: To access the code you can look up user ashtonenrriques on github.com and my account should show up. You can then go to my p1-start repository. The main block of code is located within the main directory and is called plot.py. There is one folder and several files in the main directory as well, these are named very bluntly if they are of any interest. The most useful thing in addition to the code would be the raw-data folder, this contains the initial data I wrote this program to read and graph.
